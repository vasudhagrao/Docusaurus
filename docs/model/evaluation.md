# Evaluation

We used the following metrics to evaluate models:

- **Accuracy**
- **Precision & Recall**
- **F1-score**
- **Confusion Matrix**

We observed that deep learning models reduced false positives compared to traditional ML.

| Metric     | Value  |
|------------|--------|
| Accuracy   | 93%    |
| Precision  | 91%    |
| Recall     | 94%    |
| F1-score   | 92%    |
