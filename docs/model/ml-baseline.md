# Baseline Machine Learning Models

We started with traditional ML models:

- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest**
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**

TF-IDF vectors were used as input features. Among these, SVM provided the best F1-score on the validation set.

**Metrics:**
- Accuracy: 91%
- Precision: 89%
- Recall: 92%
