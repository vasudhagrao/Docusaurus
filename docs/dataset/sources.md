# Dataset Sources

We used a public dataset of tweets labeled as "spam" or "not spam" from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). The dataset includes:

- Tweet text
- User metadata (e.g., follower count, account age)
- Label: spam or ham

This dataset was ideal for binary classification and provided a good balance of real-world noise and labeling quality.
